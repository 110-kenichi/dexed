Dexed DX7 Software Emulator
===========================

Dexed is a multiplatform, multiformat plugin synth that is closely modeled on the Yamaha DX7. 
Under the hood, it uses [music-synthesizer-for-android](https://code.google.com/p/music-synthesizer-for-android) 
for the synth engine and [JUCE](http://wwww.juce.com) as a plugin wrapper.

Dexed is licensed on the GPL v2. The msfa component (music synthesizer for android, see msfa in the source 
folder) stays on the Apache 2.0 license to able to collaborate between projects.
